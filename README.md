# Data Structures: Assignment 5
Updates Assignment 4 so that the data is now stored in a hash table, rather than a tree or array

## Assignment details from the course
In this assignment, you are asked to store UPC data given in assignment4 in a hash table size with 1000. Please provide an implementation for Hashing with Separate Chaining collision resolution strategy. Modify your code in assignment4 and perform experiments using your hashing implementation. Keep timing for experiments and draw a graph to compare the results of the performances of three implementations: unsorted array, binary search tree and hashing.
